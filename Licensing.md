##User Quota Management

What happens if a bunch of your users are all viewing dashboards or running queries at the same time? What happens if they keep hitting the refresh button? QualeQuest OEM's quota management allows you to bullet-proof queries against your database by enforcing flexible quota policies that can take into account concurrency, time of day, day of week, complexity of query, and production load on your database.
	
##In-Memory Caching

Databases can't execute some kinds of queries fast enough to power real-time, interactive apps,  
With QualeQuest OEM, some kinds of static queries can be off loaded and cached in the server memory or even the browser to deliver blazing fast response times for a winning end-user experience.
	
##Scheduled Queries

Many times, it's more efficient to run nightly or weekly queries that rollup data and massage it into a form that's easier to pipe into an interactive dashboard.
