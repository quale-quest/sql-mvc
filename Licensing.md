#Licensing of the enclosed work

This is a commercial open source project, It is free as in speech
but not free as in beer, but cheap as in peanuts.

##Opening
At the moment the licence is work in progress, it is brief and written in simple English, hopefully with clear intent. 
Initially this licence may be unfairly biased against the developer, customer or public good, 
it is not my intention keep it this way but initially it is the safest way (for me) until I get it sorted.

##Licence
All rights reserved, anything not specified in the licence is forbidden.
This work is experimental, no warranties given or liabilities accepted.

##Abandon-ware 
Should this work cease to be further developed or maintained for a period of 12 months or more,
by the licensor or its assignees in any further form or name, the licensor grants that this work shall automatically
 become MIT / BSD 3 clause / or any GPL licensed at the discretion of the individual.

##Definitions
**core** is any part that is generic. (should not contain, or does not in the standard distribution or the initial distribution contain
or is not made to primarily contain customer specific code).
**extended core** any part adjunct to the core to extend the core that may contain customer specific code but that is not necessarily application specific.

**customer** any part that has a specific customer purpose, that cannot generally be applied to other customers.


##Grant to you
In terms of this licence you are granted the right to use this work subject to the conditions of this licence.
Use is subject to payment of a fee as determined from time to time and adjusted in terms of inflation.
The fee currently is ($7 per application per server) or (10% of the capex and infrastructure cost of the utilising the application) which ever is the higher amount.
The fee is not required for evaluation of the work.

Any use or improvement you make to the *customer* parts of the work belongs to you.

Any change or improvement you make to the *core* or *extended core* (even if used in private) will automatically belong to the licensor as it 
becomes part of core and its licensing, and *must* be shared with the licensor whom will consider it for inclusion into future releases.
Attribution will be given to all contributors. 

If you wish to make a change to the core that you want to retain ownership of this has to be negotiated with the licensor under a separate licence.


##Normal legal stuff
What ever housekeeping stuff you will find in other  commercial open source project that do not conflict with above bits.
