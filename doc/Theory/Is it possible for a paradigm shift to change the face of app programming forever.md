#Is it possible for a paradigm shift to change the face of app programming forever?

Since whenever, imperative programming paradigm has been driving web development forward, declarative (functional) programming languages, have had only minor attention.

For some years I have been implementing web apps in a declarative/reactive paradigm.
Other frameworks are also enabling similar paradigms using Javascript and other imperative programming languages, which result in greatly improved productivity.

However is it possible challenge the use of imperative programming languages?

For some time now I have been building web apps using a declarative/reactive language based on SQL which I call QUALE/QUICC.

I know the paradigm works because I have built quite comprehensive apps with it, I know it is quick to develop with, because I deliver fast,
but I am no fancy computer scientist, just a pragmatic developer so I am looking for some validation of the concepts.


Please have a look at how I do it and enter into meaningful discussion.
