#Origin

Since 1999 I have been using my own platform to do the occasional custom line of business web app.
Last year (2014) I had a need to write a simple app for an embedded ARM processor (BeagleBone Black), and as my 
platform was windows only, I had to evaluate and choose from the latest app development technologies, 
I was quite amazed that app development seems to be less efficient now that back in the 90's.

So I started this project to modernize my methods, and make them available to the public. These methods were developed in isolation, as a result SQL-MVC is quite different to anything else out there.

In January 2015 published some pretty cool stuff, but nobody seems to notice it between all the "noise" of new technologies, So I started to try and document the theory behind it, I actually had to discover what I invented and find a way to express it in a theoretical manner that would illustrate the benefits, this has been great and has lead to more abstract thinking and further evolution of the concepts - truly a Quest.
