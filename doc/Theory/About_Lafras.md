Current passion : QualeQuest

I am a solo programmer, I tend to do my own thing, About 20% of my day is spent reading about programming.

I have been a self employed entrepreneur since 1992, but I focus on heavily technical aspects and less on running the business so I have had moderate success but never been able to scale the business aspects (still trying). I probably would be better of financially had I worked for a big company, but then I would not have had the privilege of doing what I love.

I started QualeQuest, because in 1999 I intuitively created a platform for web development that I used for many years, in 2014 I started to modernise, rewrite and open-source it. I published some pretty cool stuff, but nobody seems to notice it between all the "noise" of new technologies, So I started to try and document the theory behind it, I actually had to discover what I invented and find a way to express it in a theoretical manner that would illustrate the benefits, this has been great and has lead to more abstract thinking and further evolution of the concepts - truly a Quest.
